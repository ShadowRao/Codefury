#### 4. Time Tracker Extensions
To promote a healthy balance between screen time and relaxation, Euphoria includes browser extensions that track the amount of time a user spends on each tab. If a user exceeds a specified time limit on a tab, the extension will automatically close the tab to encourage breaks and reduce screen time.

#### 5. User Dashboard
Upon logging in, users will have access to a personalized dashboard that provides insights into their internet usage. This dashboard displays the amount of time spent on each app or feature of Euphoria, allowing users to track their screen time and make informed decisions about their online activities.

### Prospects

#### User Profiles and Preferences: 
Implement user profiles and customizable preferences, allowing users to personalize their relaxation experience by selecting their favorite content and setting time limits. This enhancement would greatly enhance user engagement and retention by tailoring the platform to individual preferences.

#### Gamification: 
Incorporate gamification elements into the platform to motivate users to take breaks and explore various relaxation activities. Gamification can include rewards, badges, and challenges to make relaxation more engaging and fun.

#### Integration with Wearable Devices:
